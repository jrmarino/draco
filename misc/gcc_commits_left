This is a running list of revisions to GCC which have not yet been
incorporated into draco.  The most likely reason is that it breaks
compatibility with gcc 4.5, or rather relies on changes to the c language
that isn't present in the 4.5 branch yet.  An asterisk means it can be
incorporated into the current trunk.
