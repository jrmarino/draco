The GNAT AUX Ada compiler targeted at *BSD and *Solaris platforms

GNAT AUX is based on the trunk version of Free Software Foundation's GNU
Compiler Collection.  It carries with it the GMGPL license, the modified
version of the GPL that exempts generic instantiation from resulting in
a GPL-licensed executable.  This version of GNAT also carries with it the
GCC Runtime Library Exception, so the resulting binaries have no licensing
requirements.  Binaries produced by GNAT AUX should be handled the same as
binaries produced by any FSF GNAT compiler.

GNAT AUX implements the full Ada-83, Ada-95, and Ada-2005 language standards.
It also implements some features of the draft Ada-2012 standard, which are
optionally accessible via the -gnat2012 switch or Ada_2012 pragma.
