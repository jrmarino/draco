AWS stands for Ada Web Server, but it is more than just another webserver...

AWS is a complete framework to develop web based applications.  The main
part of the framework is the embedded web server.  This small yet powerful
web server can be embedded into your application so your application will be
able to talk with a standard web browser such as Microsoft Internet Explorer
or Netscape Communicator.  Around this web server, a lot of services have
been developed.

The framework includes:
  * seb parameters module         * session server
  * SOAP support                  * WSDL generation from Ada
  * template parser               * AJAX support

  * virtual hosting support       * server push
