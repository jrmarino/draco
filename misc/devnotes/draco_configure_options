standard-base   : one stage build only
standard-lib    : library built from S1 compiler (standard-base)
standard-tools  : tools built from S1 compiler

bootstrap       : Three stage build + lib + tools
bootstrap-base  : Three stage build only
bootstrap-lib   : library built from S3 compiler (bootstrap-base)
bootstrap-tools : tools build

cross           : One stage build with foreign GAS / linker + lib + tools
cross-base      : One stage build with foreign GAS / linker only
cross-lib       : library built from existing compiler with foreign GAS / linker
cross-tools     : tools built from existing compiler with foreign GAS / linker

xeno            : Native host/build/target compiler for foreign platform + lib + tools
xeno-base       : Stage 2 foreign platform compiler built with cross-compiler from S1
xeno-lib        : Stage 2 library built from S1 cross-compiler
xeno-tools      : Stage 2 tools built from S1 cross-compiler



B) temporarily required libraries (options to be removed later)
==============================================================================================
with-mpc=[pathname]   : optional.  Allows specification of MPC library location if it's not
                                    in a standard dir (e.g. /usr/local)
with-mpfr=[pathname]  : optional.   Allows specification of MPFR library location if it's not
                                    in a standard dir (e.g. /usr/local)
with-gmp=[pathname]   : optional.   Allows specification of GMP library location if it's not
                                    in a standard dir (e.g. /usr/local)
with-iconv=[pathname] : optional.   Allows specification of iconv library location if it's not
                                    in a standard dir (e.g. /usr/local).  Likely to remain.

C) Assembler and linker options
