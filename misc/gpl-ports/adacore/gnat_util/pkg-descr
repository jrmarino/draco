Gnat_Util is a library uniting a number of GNAT sources that are used by
different tools. At the moment Gnat_Util provides GNAT sources needed by ASIS,
GNATCOLL and Gprbuild. Its main purpose is allowing to simultaneously use
tools like ASIS and GNATCOLL (and other ones based on GNAT sources, if they
are to come), which would normally cause name conflicts between the same GNAT
sources that they use. Building both of them using same set of sources that
is Gnat_Util solves this problem.
